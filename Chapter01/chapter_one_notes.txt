  What is the advantage of using true, false, and nil in Ruby?
    - 3 of the immediate object types
    - immediate object types are objects that do not require memory allocation to create
    - do not require memory indirection to access

Different numeric types for different needs

  Why are Integers so powerful?
    - they are a core numeric type
    - simplest numeric type (vs. the fraction for example)
    - good for looping (10.times do etc...)

  What numeric type should be used for fractions?
    - floats, rationals, or BigDecimal
    - rationals are exact but not as fast as floats
    - BigDecimal is exact mostly but best when dealing with a fixed precision
    - rationals are stored as an integer numerator and denominator (100/10)

  String Vs Symbol
    - Ruby treats will often convert symbols to a string to treat them in a similar way
    - ex. symbol.downcase is essentially symbol.to_s.downcase.to_sym
    - put thought into why you need a symbol/string
