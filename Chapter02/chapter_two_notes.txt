BENEFITS of Creating A Custom Class
1. encapsulates state
  - state of the object can only be naipulated in ways that make sense for the object
2. provide a simple way for calling functions related to the instances of a class 
  - called Methods in Ruby

SOLID design
1. single-responsibility principle
2. open-closed principle
3. Liskov substitution principle
4. interface segregation principle
5. dependency inversion principle

single-responsibility principle
 - a class should serve one purpose
 - "Would I be able to use any of the newly split classes in additional places in my application or library?"
 - "Do I want to be able to easily replace certain parts of this class with alternative parts?"

open-closed principle
  - a class should be open for extension but closed for modification
  - extension
    - adding instance variables and methods
  - modification
    - modifying or removing existing instance variables or methods
